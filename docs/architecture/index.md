# WP-SKOS Architecture

For contributors, and for developers who need to know how WP-SKOS works inside: where its code lives and how it loads, its functions and hooks, and what it stores. For what other plugins and themes should use, see the [Developer Reference](../developer-reference/). Coding standards for the whole suite are in HyperTaxonomy's [Contributing guide](https://hypertaxonomy.org/hypertaxonomy/architecture/contributing.html).

The Function Reference is generated from the code and its docblocks.

- **[File Structure & Loading](file-structure.html)** — the directory layout and the order files load in.
- **[Function Reference](function-reference.html)** — the public API and the functions called across files, by file.
- **[Hook Reference](hook-reference.html)** — load order, hook priorities and registrations you can't guess from a callback's name.
- **[Data Storage](data-storage.html)** — options and transients; WP-SKOS has no tables.
